# SwitchColors
A simple tweak that allows customization of the Switches compatible with iOS 13.5 and hopefully up.

# Disclaimer:
This tweak is far from done. Expect battery drain from Layout Subviews. This project is potentially **Unstable**, however I am working on it

# To Do:
Hook Setter and Getter Methods instead of Layout Subviews <br />
*Possibly Make Sure UIKit Isn't Loaded into Daemons*
